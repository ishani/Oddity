Oddity 2
======

An unfinished refactor of the original Oddity code; streamlining the hardware interface, tuning the display, examining new ways of creating interesting patterns and vfx while still staying inside a very constrained memory and performance budget...

Lots of interpolating between rotating noise LUTs. Working but unfinished.
